# Challenge 2

## **Description**

In my portfolio I have a nav section that has links to each section of my portfolio. There's a short 'about me' section with a photo of myself and then I have a section that has idea place-holders for applications that I would like to make in the future. I also added some of my contact information as well as a link to my github that way when future employers look at my portfolio they will be able to see all my work and contact me. 

## **Installation**

N/A

## **Usage**

To jump to each section of the page you can use the links at the top to navigate to which section you would like to see. There is also links in the idea place-holder images, however since I do not have any deployed applications yet, the links route you to a "sorry" image.

## **Project Status**

This is a project that will continually be updated. I plan to eventually add links to actual applications I have worked on and plan to change the design to look more professional.
